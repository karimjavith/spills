A “round-up” feature for customers using the Starling public developer API that is available to all customers and partners.

For example, with spending of **£4.35**, **£5.20** and **£0.87**, the round-up would be **£1.58**.  
This amount should then be transferred into a savings goal, helping the customer save for future adventures.
